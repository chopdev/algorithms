 * Rabin Karp substring search
 * https://brilliant.org/wiki/rabin-karp-algorithm/
 *
 * A rolling hash allows an algorithm to calculate a hash value without having to rehash the entire string. For example,
 * when searching for a word in a text, as the algorithm shifts one letter to the right (as in the animation for brute force),
 * instead of having to calculate the hash of the section of text[1:3] as it shifts from text[0:2], the algorithm can use
 * a rolling hash to do an operation on the hash to get the new hash from the old hash.
